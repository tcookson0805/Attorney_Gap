            You know, it really doesn’t matter what you write as long as you’ve 
            got a young, and beautiful, piece of text. Some people have an ability 
            to write placeholder text... It's an art you're basically born with. 
            You either have it or you don't. Lorem Ipsum's father was with Lee Harvey 
            Oswald prior to Oswald's being, you know, shot. He’s not a word hero. 
            He’s a word hero because he was captured. I like text that wasn’t captured. 
            An 'extremely credible source' has called my office and told me that 
            Lorem Ipsum's birth certificate is a fraud.
